##### Evidence 3: Goodreads (356)
<div style="padding-left:40px;">

**Prompt**

This semester you will read 20 YA books.Many of these are not difficult to read, but it is essential that you keep up with both the reading and the assignments.  In order to stay on top of things, plan to read two books per week. That pace should keep you from grief at the end of the semester. (10 points per book, 200 total/20 points for the Reading Record) 

20 books:

A)	8 class assigned books  (the 9th  and 10th will be books of your choice in connection to our multicultural book studies)
B)	1 book from Honor List (or other award winner)—please mark on reading record
C)	8 books your choice—various genres, time periods—please mark on reading record
D)	1 censored book (in addition to I am the Cheese)—please mark on reading record

NOTE: Please do not read books in which you have already read or seen the movie (Harry Potter series, Hunger Games series, The Giver quartet, Maze Runner series, Twilight Series, etc.). Where you are already familiar with these books/movies, do yourself a favor and branch out—read something new. This will benefit you in the end.
