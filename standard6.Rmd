<div style="padding-left:40px;">

**Prompt**
Students go over this [PowerPoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LeFBgGGW6knfMqZHHZxN3FWgVYuRnxpN/view?usp=sharing) with the professor. The they complete the following assingment: 


1. As you complete Goodreads, look up and record the Lexile level of each book.

2. As you complete the 25 books, imagine recommending a series of five books to a specific student. Determine the grade level and gender of the imagined student you want to write your text set for. Then, choose five books that increase in Lexile level and which are connected thematically in a way that would make sense reading them in the order you recommend.

3. List the five books and their Lexile level. For each book, give a rationale for why you would recommend that book for that student.

##### Evidence 2: Practicum (ENG 329/430)
<div style="padding-left:40px;">

**Prompt**

You will teach a minimum of three times. You can work this out with your mentor teacher. This may be for a full or partial class period. Please submit your lesson plan to me via email three days in advance of teaching. Then, I can give you some feedback and your mentor teacher can give you some feedback. Remember, your mentor teacher is still held responsible for what you teach—please make him or her a big part of your planning process. These elements need to be in your lesson plan to receive full credit: objective, standard, assessment, hook, I DO, WE DO, THEY DO, closure, and enough detail that a sub could teach your lesson. You may want to ask your mentor teacher for lesson plan templates that have been helpful to him or her. (Standard 8A (Parts of 4 and 5—depending on the lesson)).
