##### Evidence 1: Teaching Observations 1-15 (ENG 329)

<div style="padding-left:40px;">

**Prompt**

Fifteen observations in an ELA classroom setting with a mentor teacher. You will choose one topic to observe at each of your first five observations; you will choose a different topic at each new observation. As you type each observation, you will need to do the following: write ½ a page on what you learned in your Lab PLC group concerning the topic, then write the rest of your paper on your observations in connection to that topic. 

Topics:

1.	Social justice—what is it? How does it connect to the ELA classroom? (What is the teacher doing to promote social justice? What is effective? Why?)—Standard 5B
2.	How do language and dialect affect literacy? (What are teachers doing to address this in the classroom?)—Standards 2A and 3A

After completing the observation, look at your data. Now type, at the bottom of your observation (chart), your response to the following:

1.	What is the data telling you? Are there any patterns you notice? (two paragraphs)
2.	What have you learned from your observation and analysis? (two paragraphs)
