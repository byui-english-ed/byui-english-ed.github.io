Recruitment efforts for the English Education Program include:

* Participation in the administrationâ€™s freshmen orientation materials
* A Pre-Professional Conference
* Advising that takes place in Eng. 251 and Eng. 314
 

The English Education Program is working on adding a recruitment meeting with all English majors to take place through the English Academic Society.  This would take place after COVID restrictions on meetings has been lifted.  This meeting will highlight the appeal of choosing education as an emphasis for those that are unsure how to focus their English major and also for those that may be considering graduate school after graduation and could benefit from an education background.
