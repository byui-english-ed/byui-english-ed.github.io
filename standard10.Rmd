This observation’s directions and chart come directly from “Bringing Reality to Classroom Management in Teacher Education” by Gordon Eisenman, Susan Edwards, and Carey Anne Cushman—Georgia Regents University).

For one hour, select one student to observe. Briefly describe what the student is doing at five-minute intervals. Would you consider this on-task or off-task behavior (engaged in activity that leads to learning)? What precipitated each positive or negative event?—Standards 3A and 10A.

After completing the observation, look at your data. Now do two things with this data:

Analyze what the data is telling you. (Are there any patterns you notice?)
Discuss what you have learned from your observation and analysis.
